[Path With Minimum Effort](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort/description/)

## Topic
- Dijkstra
- Priority Queue

## Approach
- We define possible direction in each cell (left, right, up, down)
- Using relaxation and maximum effort, run dijkstra 

## Note
- Terminating when arrived at ROW-1, COL-1 idx remarkably shrinks the computation time.
